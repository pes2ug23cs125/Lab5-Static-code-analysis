## ‚ú® Code Quality Improvements

This code has been improved to resolve critical issues, including:

* **Security:** Removed the dangerous `eval()` function.
* **Bugs:** Fixed the **mutable default argument** issue in `add_item`.
* **Robustness:** Implemented **resource management** (`with open(...)`) and specific **error handling** (`except KeyError`).
* **Style:** Converted to standard **snake\_case** naming and added **docstrings**.
